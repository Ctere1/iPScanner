**iPScanner is a compact, native macOS tool for everyday IPv4 network discovery.**
Find responding devices, inspect names and services, add searchable labels, and
save or export what you find. Built with SwiftUI; signed in-app updates are powered by Sparkle.

> **1.3.0 is available:** [Download the signed, notarized DMG](https://github.com/canberkys/iPScanner/releases/download/v1.3.0/iPScanner-v1.3.0.dmg).
> Fixes the v1.2.0 opening issue ([#10](https://github.com/canberkys/iPScanner/issues/10)).
> See the [release notes](https://github.com/canberkys/iPScanner/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
> for validation details and known platform limitations.

## Everyday tasks, one window

| Task | In iPScanner |
|---|---|
| Discover devices | Enter an IP, CIDR, range or imported target list. Choose Quick, Standard or Deep. |
| Understand a result | Inspect DNS, MAC/vendor status, open ports, Bonjour services and device-type evidence. |
| Find it again | Add labels and #tags, search results, filter the table and save named networks. |
| Compare and share | Save a snapshot, compare changes, or export CSV, JSON, IP:Port and text reports. |
| Connect and troubleshoot | Open connection tools, check live ping, inspect service banners or send Wake-on-LAN. |

## Get started

Download the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/canberkys/iPScanner/releases),
drag **iPScanner** to **Applications**, then open it.

1. Choose your network from the subnet menu or enter a target you administer.
2. Leave the profile on **Standard** and select **Scan**. **Stop** cancels the run.
3. Search the results or select a device and open **Device Details** (`⌘⌥I`).
4. Add a label, save a snapshot or use **Export** above the results.

**Options** contains scan profiles and repeat intervals. **Tools** contains target
import, the subnet calculator and port scans. AFP and Telnet live under **Advanced**.
See [all features](docs/features.md) or open **Help → iPScanner Help** in the app.

### Try the sample without scanning a network

Download [demo.ipscan.json](docs/media/demo.ipscan.json) using GitHub's **Download raw file**
button. In the app, use **File → Open Scan…** (`⌘O`) to load it. Search for `#lab`
to see tag filtering. Loading the snapshot does not start a discovery scan.
Opening details for the first row runs the ping monitor against localhost only.

### Updates and feedback

- **Automatic update checks:** optional daily checks through Sparkle.
  Manual checks are available in Help and Settings.
- **In-app installation:** review release notes, download and install a signed update.
  Install 1.3.0 manually once to receive future releases through Sparkle.
- **Feedback:** review your draft in the app before sending it through Cloudflare
  to a **public GitHub issue**. A GitHub account is not required to submit in-app.

### What the results mean

A responding device is observable from your current network; a timeout does not
prove a device is offline. MAC addresses may be unavailable across routers or
because of OS privacy restrictions. Local/randomized MACs do not establish a
manufacturer. Device types are estimates, with evidence in the details view.
Sending a Wake-on-LAN packet does not confirm that a device woke up.

On macOS 27, MAC access may require additional signed capabilities and provisioning.
This remains an [open verification item](docs/acceptance-1.3.0.md).

## Command-line interface

The universal CLI is bundled at `iPScanner.app/Contents/Helpers/ipscanner` and uses
the same discovery engine and export models as the GUI.

```bash
# Quick check of this Mac's loopback address
/Applications/iPScanner.app/Contents/Helpers/ipscanner scan 127.0.0.1 --profile quick

# Scan your target file and write JSON
/Applications/iPScanner.app/Contents/Helpers/ipscanner scan \
  --input targets.csv --profile standard --format json --output scan.json
```

Run `--help` for all options. Exit codes: `0` success, `1` input error, `2` runtime error.
The old `Contents/MacOS/ipscanner` path has moved to avoid the filename collision in #10.

## Build and test

Requirements: macOS, Xcode with an SDK supporting the macOS 14.4 deployment target,
and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/canberkys/iPScanner.git
cd iPScanner
xcodegen generate
open iPScanner.xcodeproj
```

Choose the **iPScanner** scheme and run with `⌘R`.

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme iPScanner -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=-
python3 scripts/build-vendor-db.py --check
(cd feedback-relay && npm test)
```

The latest local validation passed **190 application tests and 6 Worker tests**.
See the [acceptance table](docs/acceptance-1.3.0.md) for tested methods and limitations;
a universal build is not proof of testing on Intel hardware or every supported OS.

## Privacy and distribution

- No telemetry. Discovery runs on the targets you select.
- GitHub is contacted for update checks; feedback is sent only when you submit it.
  Scan results, IPs and MACs are not attached to feedback automatically.
- Vendor matching uses a compact offline IEEE index. Raw pinned sources and
  provenance notes are in [data/ieee](data/ieee/).
- Signed packaging validates GUI/CLI identity, architectures, notarization,
  stapling, DMG integrity and SHA-256. [Signing guide](docs/signing-guide-tr.md).

## What's next

Continue the remaining compatibility and accessibility checks. History, IPv6 and menu-bar mode
are outside the current update. [Follow-up work](docs/next-phase-plan-tr.md).
