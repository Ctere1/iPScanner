# Changelog

All notable changes to iPScanner are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.1] — 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Restore Add Label / Edit Label in the device context menu; preserve labels when MAC information arrives later and when saving snapshots.
- Keep scan controls at the top and status at the bottom when no rows are visible; explain active filters while discovery continues.
- Bound ping process duration and skip ping name resolution so unresponsive addresses cannot prolong discovery unnecessarily.
- Scan the right-clicked port-scan targets and disable the action while another scan is active.
- Clear imported targets when selecting a saved network.
- Exclude previously unresponsive targets from missing-device comparisons, normalize MAC badge keys, and refresh comparisons after loading, deleting or refreshing devices.
- Show file-save failures and synchronize externally changed labels with the device inspector.

### Changed

- Present installation in a compact branded disk-image window with a clear drag-to-Applications guide and Retina artwork.

- Align repository metadata and documentation with the published signed release and Sparkle updates.
- Add contributor and support guides, clarify public feedback, and update issue and pull request templates.

### Removed

- Remove obsolete artwork, unused demo frames and superseded development notes; keep current screenshots and release validation in one place.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-26

### Added (New)

- Add Sparkle update checks and signed in-app installation, with shared Settings and menu controls. The public feed delivers future releases.
- Run application tests and package validation on pull requests and pushes to main.
- Explain vendor lookup outcomes and the evidence behind estimated device types.
- Preserve optional vendor-status metadata in JSON exports and scan snapshots.

- Native help topics for first scans, profiles, troubleshooting, snapshots and shortcuts.
- Feedback drafts for bugs and feature requests, with optional environment details,
  preview, clipboard fallback and direct Cloudflare delivery to public GitHub issues.
- Settings for scan profile, appearance and automatic update checks, with manual
  checks available in Help and Settings.

### Changed

- Refresh the radar app icon and present the device table, details and export in a short optional tour.
- Refresh the GitHub overview with a captioned UI walkthrough, current light/dark screenshots and a downloadable sample snapshot.
- Ship a validated compact IEEE prefix index instead of raw registry address files.
- Move legacy AFP/Telnet connections and raw vendor database access into Advanced.
- Show connection launch failures and distinguish Wake-on-LAN packet delivery from wake confirmation.

- Load IEEE assignment records without running regular expressions on every
  address line, reducing the initial vendor database loading delay.
- Compact two-row controls, optional saved-ranges sidebar and explicit device details.
- Device details adapt between a sheet and a side panel; minimum window is 800 × 540.
- CLI moves to `Contents/Helpers/ipscanner` and builds as `ipscanner-cli` to prevent
  case-insensitive filename collisions with the GUI executable (#10).
- Release builds require Developer ID, Hardened Runtime, notarization, stapling,
  architecture checks, final DMG validation and SHA-256 checksums. CI prepares drafts.
- Deep discovery, ports and banners share one cancellable lifecycle; rescans wait
  for every phase and stale results cannot overwrite a later run or snapshot.
- Imported targets can start and rescan with an empty range input.


### Security
- Snapshot (`.ipscan.json`) `ip` fields are now validated as IPv4 on decode, and
  `HostActions` guards the same fields again before shelling out — a crafted
  snapshot could previously inject arbitrary shell commands via the SSH /
  Telnet / Ping-in-Terminal / RDP actions.

### Fixed
- Verify universal slices consistently during signed packaging and accept a certificate fingerprint when a signing name contains non-ASCII characters.
- Preserve labels saved with short ARP MAC addresses and avoid false snapshot changes caused by MAC formatting.
- Keep pending label edits attached to the original device when selection changes.
- Explain macOS 27 MAC access restrictions when ARP returns no records.
- Validate complete MAC addresses across common formats; never infer a vendor from locally administered or group addresses.
- Clear stale device enrichment on refresh and retain historical status for saved information.
- Stop classifying phones and Macs as routers merely because their DNS suffix contains hgw.
- Remove vanished Bonjour services and reject stale resolutions after a browse restart.
- Bound ARP execution and report command, parsing and timeout errors separately.

- Large CIDR/range inputs (GUI, CLI, and file import) are now bounds-checked
  *before* expanding into an address list, instead of after — a `/8` or wider
  range could previously exhaust memory before the existing target-count limit
  ever ran.
- Snapshot save/load now preserves each host's alive/dead status instead of
  marking everything alive on reload, and no longer crashes on a snapshot
  containing duplicate IPs or MACs.
- `DNSResolver.reverseLookup`'s timeout now actually bounds wall-clock time;
  previously Swift's structured-concurrency rules meant the function still
  waited for the underlying blocking `getnameinfo()` call to finish even after
  the timeout "won".
- `PortScanner.probe` now stops enqueueing new ports once its `Task` is
  cancelled, instead of draining the full port list one timeout window at a
  time after Stop is pressed.
- `NetBIOSResolver` no longer assumes every NBSTAT response echoes back a
  question section — real Windows/Samba responses typically set `QDCOUNT = 0`.
- The Deep profile's auto banner-fetch now targets the hosts that were
  actually port-scanned instead of the UI's current row selection (previously
  no banners were fetched at all if nothing was selected), and the snapshot
  diff is recomputed after the deep port/banner pass completes so newly found
  open ports show up in change badges.
- The CLI now matches the GUI's Deep-profile behavior (auto port scan +
  banner fetch without requiring `--ports`), preserves NetBIOS
  name/workgroup when merging host records, and its CSV/JSON export now
  includes NetBIOS name, workgroup, service title, and host status —
  previously dropped from every export format.
- `build-dmg.sh` now bundles the `ipscanner` CLI into the app the same way the
  release CI does, so local and CI-built DMGs no longer differ.
- Release CI now syncs `MARKETING_VERSION` from the pushed tag instead of
  relying on a manual version-bump commit.
- The custom About panel no longer hardcodes its version string — it now
  reads `CFBundleShortVersionString` from the bundle, so it can't drift from
  what CI actually shipped.
- The toolbar's range and search fields now have a `minWidth`, so a crowded
  toolbar state (Deep profile + live scan results, at the app's own minimum
  window width) no longer squeezes the range input down to a few pixels —
  confirmed live: it previously collapsed to ~15pt, now holds a usable width
  and any residual overflow clips a less-essential control instead.
